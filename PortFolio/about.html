            <h3>Software Developer</h3>
            <p>
                Hello, I'm Pradeepkumar Rajan, a passionate software developer specializing in full-stack development.
                I have experience working with technologies such as Java,JavaScript,Vb.net, and C++. I thrive
                on solving complex problems and building efficient, scalable applications. In my professional journey,
                I aim to continually improve and adapt to new challenges, ensuring that the products I build are both
                functional and user-friendly.
            </p>

            <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
            <p>
                Beyond coding, I am deeply passionate about Photography. Whether it's playing a musical instrument,
                creating art, or traveling to new destinations, I find inspiration everywhere. I believe that pursuing
                your passions outside of work keeps you motivated and fosters creativity. It's important to maintain a
                balance between your professional and personal life, and my hobbies help me do just that. I enjoy
                learning new skills, whether it's in tech or something creative, and I'm always looking for ways to
                grow both personally and professionally.
